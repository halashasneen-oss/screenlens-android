# ScreenLens — Build Report

Project: ScreenLens
Package: `com.screenlens.app`
Version: 1.0.0 (versionCode 1)
Build Date: 2026-08-10

## Environment inspected

| Tool | Version found | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Java | OpenJDK 21.0.10 | Project targets Java/Kotlin JVM compatibility 17 |
| Gradle | 8.14.3 (wrapper) | Reused the working wrapper already present in this repo |
| Android Gradle Plugin | 8.9.1 | |
| Kotlin | 2.0.21 | |
| Android SDK (`ANDROID_HOME`/`ANDROID_SDK_ROOT`) | **Not installed** | No `cmdline-tools`, `platforms`, or `build-tools` present anywhere in this container |

## Local build attempt

```
$ ./gradlew tasks
FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.
Plugin [id: 'com.android.application', version: '8.9.1', apply: false] was not found ...
Searched in the following repositories:
    Google
    MavenRepo
    Gradle Central Plugin Repository
```

**Root cause:** this session's outbound network policy blocks `dl.google.com`
(HTTP 403, confirmed via `curl` and the proxy status endpoint:
`"host": "dl.google.com:443"`, `"detail": "gateway answered 403 to CONNECT
(policy denial or upstream failure)"`). Google's Maven repository
(`google()` in `settings.gradle.kts`) and the Android SDK component
downloader both resolve through `dl.google.com`, so **neither the Android
Gradle Plugin, AndroidX/Material/ML Kit dependencies, nor an Android SDK
platform/build-tools could be downloaded in this environment.** This is an
infrastructure/network-policy limitation of the sandbox this session ran in,
not a defect in the project. (ScreenLens was first developed in a subfolder
of a sibling repository under the same account, which has this same network
constraint and is likewise built exclusively via GitHub Actions, before
being migrated here as its own dedicated repository.)

Per instructions, **no build step below is reported as passing unless it
actually ran and Gradle reported success.** None of the local build/test/
lint/assemble commands could execute at all in this environment, so none are
claimed to have passed.

| Step | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `./gradlew test` (unit tests) | **NOT RUN** — blocked by missing Android SDK / dependency resolution |
| `./gradlew lint` | **NOT RUN** — same reason |
| `./gradlew assembleDebug` | **NOT RUN** — same reason |
| `./gradlew assembleRelease` | **NOT RUN** — same reason (also no signing secrets present) |
| `./gradlew bundleRelease` | **NOT RUN** — same reason |

Debug APK: **not produced.**
Release APK: **not produced.**
Release AAB: **not produced.**

## What was verified instead

Since Gradle could not run, correctness was checked by direct inspection
rather than execution:

- Every Kotlin file compiles logically against the API surfaces it calls
  (ML Kit Text Recognition/Translate/Language ID/Barcode Scanning, CameraX,
  MediaProjection, Room, DataStore, Navigation Safe Args, Play Billing v7,
  Google Mobile Ads) based on their documented public APIs.
- All 158 files in this repository were written directly for this project;
  none are placeholders, and no OCR/translation/history result anywhere in
  the code is hardcoded or simulated — every result comes from a real
  Android/ML Kit API call, or the UI shows an explicit, honest limitation
  message when a real API constraint applies (see `README.md` → *Known
  limitations*).
- No `TODO`/`FIXME` markers were introduced.
- Repo-relative resource references (`@string`, `@drawable`, `@layout`,
  nav-graph action IDs, ViewBinding property names) were manually
  cross-checked between XML and Kotlin call sites.

**This is not a substitute for a real compile.** The authoritative build
status for this project is whatever `.github/workflows/android-build.yml`
reports on GitHub Actions, which runs in an environment with real Android
SDK + Google Maven access. Until that workflow has run at least once (or you
build locally on a machine with normal internet access), treat the
project as **unverified by compilation**, even though it was authored
carefully and reviewed line-by-line.

## Tests

Written (see `README.md` → *Testing* for the full list): `HistoryDaoTest`,
`HistoryRepositoryTest`, `SettingsDataStoreTest`, `LanguageCatalogTest`,
`HistoryMappingTest`, `HistoryDisplayTest`, `OcrOutcomeTest`.

Unit Tests: **NOT RUN** (see above) — PASS/FAIL is unknown until CI runs them.
Lint: **NOT RUN** — PASS/FAIL is unknown until CI runs it.
Debug APK: **FAIL to produce** (network-blocked, not a code failure)
Release APK: **FAIL to produce** (no signing secrets configured + network-blocked)
AAB: **FAIL to produce** (same)

## GitHub

Repository: https://github.com/halashasneen-oss/screenlens-android
Commit SHA: see final response (reported after `git push` actually succeeds).

## Security Scan

Performed before each commit: recursive search across the whole project for
AWS/Google API key patterns, PEM private key headers, OAuth bearer/
Slack-style tokens, and by filename for `*.keystore`, `*.jks`,
`secrets.properties`, `.env`, `google-services.json`, `local.properties`.

Secrets Found: **NO**
Result: **PASS**

`secrets.properties.example` contains only empty placeholder keys, matching
the project's `.gitignore`, which excludes `secrets.properties`, `*.keystore`,
`*.jks`, `local.properties`, and `.idea/`.

## Known Limitations

See `README.md` → *Known limitations* for the full list, summarized:

1. Arabic **OCR** (reading Arabic glyphs from images/screens) is not
   available — ML Kit's on-device Text Recognition only supports
   Latin-alphabet script. Arabic **translation** and the Arabic **app UI**
   both work fully.
2. Premium purchases are architecturally real (Play Billing v7) but
   inactive — no product exists in Play Console yet, so the app correctly
   reports "not configured."
3. This sandbox has no Android SDK and no access to `dl.google.com`, so no
   local Gradle build could be executed or verified here.
4. No production AdMob/Play Billing identifiers are configured; debug and
   (until secrets are added) release builds use Google's public test IDs.
5. No store screenshots are included (see `store-assets/README.md`) — they
   must come from an actual running build.
